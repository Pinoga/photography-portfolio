# photography-portfolio
A photography portfolio that list photos in randomized sizes and layout 
It's currently in a **very** early stage, but the idea is to show a different layout everytime the user visits the webpage.
## Requirements
- Photos doesn't necessarily have to fit a NxM grid
- The layout should be randomized
- The layout should be desktop/tablet/mobile-friendly
- There should be an auto-placement algorithm that prioritizes certain images and fits the others afterwards in the remaning spaces
## Example
